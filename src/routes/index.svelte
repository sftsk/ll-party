		As you might know by now we've got married in December 2021 and it's about time to celebrate
		with our friends.
		<br />
		The party will take place on 10.09.2022 in Marlengo, Italy and if the weather goods are with us take
		place outdoors.<br /><br />
		We are looking to provide some place to sleep for people who aren't too picky and obviously we can
		help you find a hotel if you prefer that. Please let us know in the RSVP form.<br />
		The easiest way to get there from Finland is to fly to Munich or Milan and take a rental car, train
		or bus. When it's clearer who will come we can try to plan something together as much as possible.<br
		/><br />
		There will be food, music and hopefully loads of fun. Bring your dancing shoes and dress however
		you want! No need for presents, if you really insist we are happy with a little something towards
		our honeymoon: IBAN0123...
		<br /><br />
		Please click on the following button to fill out our RSVP from. It will make our time a lot easier.
